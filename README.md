**Hell-Quiz**
---------

A small challenging console game, written in C# for our first team project at **Telerik Academy** (2015) - ***Team "Ogre Mage"***

**Description**
-----------

You get a random question and  you must collect the falling letters in order to form the answer.
But be careful, bombs are being dropped. If you **catch a bomb** - you **lose life points**. 

If you catch a wrong letter, you must scout for a **"delete" symbol** and collect it. 
These symbols are magical and **remove the last collected letter**.

Have fun while thinking about an answer and trying to move your way through a field with random letters and dangerous mysterious objects.
