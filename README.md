# Hell-Quiz
A small challenging console game, written in C#.
You get a random question and  you must collect the falling letters in order to form an answer.
But be careful, bombs are being dropped. If you catch a bomb - you lose life points. 
YOU FAIL BRO, YOU FAIL IN LIFE...
If you catch a wrong letter, you must scout for a "delete" symbol. They are magical and remove the last collected letter.
Have fun thinking about an answer and moving at the same time.
